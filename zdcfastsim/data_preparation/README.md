# Data preparation

- Put here generated examples in this folder
- Use `root -q -b -l Extract.C` that will give you 4 files
    - `all_examples.txt` that contains all examples
    - `non_zero_examples.txt` that contains only examples that have at least one generated photon in one of detectors
    - `neutron_image.txt` that contains neutron detector response if there is at least one photon in one of detectors
    - `proton_image.txt` that contains proton detector response if there is at least one photon in one of detectors
- Repository result files for small case; central neutrons from box generator in the range 80keV to 1GeV
